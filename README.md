# üîê **AWS Security Groups vs Network ACLs ‚Äì Detailed Guide**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **What Are Security Groups?**

**Security Groups (SGs)** are **virtual firewalls** for **EC2 instances** and other AWS resources like RDS databases or Elastic Load Balancers.

They **control inbound and outbound traffic** *at the instance level*.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features:**

* **Instance-level firewall** (applied directly to ENIs ‚Äî Elastic Network Interfaces)
* **Stateful** ‚Äì If traffic is allowed in, the return traffic is automatically allowed out (and vice versa).
* **Allow rules only** ‚Äì You cannot create ‚Äúdeny‚Äù rules.
* Supports rules by:

  * **IP range** (CIDR block)
  * **Another security group**
  * **Port and protocol**
* You can attach multiple security groups to a single resource.

---

### üì• **Inbound Rules Example**

| Type  | Protocol | Port Range | Source           |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| SSH   | TCP      | 22         | 203.0.113.0/24   |
| HTTP  | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0        |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443        | MyLoadBalancerSG |

---

### üì§ **Outbound Rules Example**

| Type | Protocol | Port Range | Destination |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| All  | All      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0   |

---

üìå **Best Practices for SGs:**

* Use **least privilege** (only open the ports and IPs you need).
* Use **separate SGs** for different roles (e.g., web server SG, DB SG).
* Reference **SGs instead of IPs** when linking resources (e.g., allow only ‚ÄúWebServerSG‚Äù to talk to ‚ÄúDatabaseSG‚Äù).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **What Are Network ACLs (NACLs)?**

**Network Access Control Lists** are **stateless firewalls** that operate **at the subnet level** in a VPC.

They control **inbound and outbound traffic to and from entire subnets**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features:**

* **Subnet-level firewall** ‚Äì affects all resources in that subnet.
* **Stateless** ‚Äì Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by outbound rules.
* Can have **allow** and **deny** rules.
* Rules are **evaluated in order** from the lowest rule number to the highest.
* Default NACL allows all traffic in and out unless modified.

---

### üì• **Inbound NACL Rule Example**

| Rule # | Allow/Deny | Protocol | Port Range | Source    |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 100    | ALLOW      | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| 110    | DENY       | TCP      | 22         | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| \*     | DENY       | All      | All        | All       |

---

### üì§ **Outbound NACL Rule Example**

| Rule # | Allow/Deny | Protocol | Port Range | Destination |
| ------ | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 100    | ALLOW      | TCP      | 1024-65535 | 0.0.0.0/0   |
| \*     | DENY       | All      | All        | All         |

---

üìå **Best Practices for NACLs:**

* Use NACLs to **block specific traffic** at the subnet level (e.g., known malicious IP ranges).
* Always have a **catch-all DENY rule** at the end (implicit anyway).
* For public subnets, allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS and ephemeral ports for return traffic.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Groups vs NACLs ‚Äì Side-by-Side Comparison**

| Feature              | Security Group                       | Network ACL                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**            | Instance level (ENI)                 | Subnet level                                |
| **Stateful?**        | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚ùå No (stateless)                            |
| **Rules Type**       | Allow only                           | Allow & Deny                                |
| **Default Behavior** | Deny all inbound, allow all outbound | Allow all inbound & outbound (default NACL) |
| **Evaluation Order** | All rules evaluated before decision  | Rules evaluated in order by rule number     |
| **Typical Use**      | Control specific resource access     | Add extra layer of subnet-level filtering   |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **How They Work Together in AWS**

* **Traffic to an EC2 instance** must pass **both** the NACL for the subnet and the Security Group(s) attached to the instance.
* If either blocks the traffic, it‚Äôs denied.
* SGs are **first line of defense at the instance level**, NACLs provide **network-wide filtering**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-World AWS Example**

Imagine you have:

* **Public subnet** for web servers
* **Private subnet** for databases

**Security Groups:**

* WebServerSG allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere and outbound to DBServerSG on port 3306.
* DBServerSG allows inbound from WebServerSG only.

**NACLs:**

* PublicSubnetNACL allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS from 0.0.0.0/0, denies all other inbound.
* PrivateSubnetNACL allows inbound MySQL (3306) only from PublicSubnet's CIDR.

This **defense-in-depth** approach means:

1. Even if a SG is misconfigured, NACL provides a backup.
2. Attacks from malicious IPs can be blocked subnet-wide.

To demonstarate this concepts, the mini project would be carried out in two parts

-----------------------------------------------
PART 1
a) An instance my-test-instance was launched and a web application was transfered into the appropriate location to be served by apache. The security group for the instance allows only inbound ssh traffic.

b) Upon retreving the public IP address and opening, the web app coundnt be reached
<img width="953" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9415acc9-ac63-496e-b8a6-37abb9ebc9d4" />
<img width="959" height="473" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9012a7b2-edf9-46d6-ae30-e7a706b02a02" />
c) Edit or create a security group and allow http on port 80.
<img width="951" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748e9d54-6737-4aa6-82c6-6caa9ea4d6e3" />
<img width="941" height="341" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/780eccc3-8c68-4ac6-807e-43a69c54567a" />
<img width="946" height="381" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57cc339-a4f7-4149-9107-5eae9d5c536f" />
d) Reload the public IP
<img width="959" height="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/946f0966-b2a8-4193-b208-8781308ba281" />

e) Lets see what happens when we edit the outbound rules 
<img width="941" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d5c289e-b79a-4724-95c3-09aa189bdec2" />
<img width="951" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4306c248-2577-4d2f-81d7-ee80fca525c9" />
<img width="959" height="379" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c7ce3b8-7307-44f8-a478-63fa01fda6c5" />
<img width="955" height="404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9840bca-b2de-4593-994e-4914d1d4e33a" />
<img width="956" height="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dbc132b-44a8-4db8-9536-80397b5cd6ae" />
This clearly demonstrates the stateful property of security groups.

f) If we delete both inbound and outbound rules, lets see if we would reach the web app.
<img width="946" height="383" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e10ee495-d417-42c9-92fb-942758937ebb" />
<img width="950" height="385" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ff0c4f-5e11-414d-bab5-6a77a8cfa6fa" />
<img width="955" height="404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9840bca-b2de-4593-994e-4914d1d4e33a" />
<img width="940" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c99638ec-cea3-4b68-9837-fcd2b3afe642" />
The web page times out. 

Now, let us edit the outbound rules and allow http on port 80.
<img width="952" height="299" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40cd57b1-1133-4199-9fd2-75d913b16280" />
<img width="937" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1884c765-f259-4052-ab82-576d48c81f0a" />
<img width="959" height="496" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8700d505-c6ca-4b77-ac0c-7153cf5704c1" />
but there is connectivity with the local host
<img width="959" height="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e35768bd-9bd9-4df7-8021-c0fed0d2f630" />

PART 2

a) navigate to vpc and click on NACLs
<img width="957" height="436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c67c7c68-8bbc-49fa-b422-c3f4bea9ec79" />
<img width="950" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71036da2-7fda-454e-96ac-480b1ef1d88c" />
<img width="936" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd458ad-aaa4-416a-924e-d7627e8141b3" />
<img width="928" height="382" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f18007f-f4a0-40c5-b1aa-ce2aba2181a0" />
both inbound and outbound allow traffic from anywhere IPv4. Hence, the web app displays
<img width="956" height="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826499da-073a-4abb-8ee0-21eb398abe3c" />

b) now lets edit only the outbound and check again
<img width="943" height="422" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58bc14a8-e713-48a2-a64c-5532a8335ec7" />

<img width="949" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dbc0fdb-715c-439a-9856-8f7f3117b5e2" />

<img width="950" height="481" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0df1f88-15ed-4782-8e86-6eacfd7cf008" />

this reinforces how stateless NACLs are.
